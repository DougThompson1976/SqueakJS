SqueakJS: A Lively Squeak VM
============================

This GitHub repository contains mainly the interpreter. The HTML user interface is written using the Lively Kernel.
The "demo" directory contains a simplified version of the interface, just enough to run the VM.

For more information, please visit the [home page][homepage].

Contributions are very welcome!
