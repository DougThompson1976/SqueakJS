SqueakJS: A Lively Squeak VM
============================

This GitHub repository contains mainly the interpreter. The HTML user interface is written using the Lively Kernel.

To see this VM in action visit the [Lively Squeak page][livelysqueak]. For a quick test you can use the simplified HTML page in this repo: [simple.html][simplesqueak].

I'm currently working on loading more demanding images. The Lively Squeak interface supports dropping a Squeak image from your local disk into the world. E.g., the [Etoys][etoys] image loads, but does not run successfully yet.

Contributions are very welcome!
